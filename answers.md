## 1. Challenges and dilemmas

List at list 2 challenges or dilemmas that you faced while building the design in Part 1,
and how you decided to solve them?

**Answer:**

## 2. Box model

Build the `.hello-world` example from the lesson 1 "CSS Box Model" slides, exactly as it appears
there, on a new page of your website. This page is only for answering questions
2 and 4, so it can be a temporary file, and you don't need to submit it.

Inspect the element with your browser's devtools.
Enable and disable `box-sizing: border-box;` and inspect the size of the element.
What is the total width, and why? Explain in detail.

**Answer:**
The total size without `box-sizing: border-box;` is 114px and with " " " " is 100px
thats because without `box-sizing: border-box;` the padding (5px each side) and the border(2px each side)
are added to the width to give a total of 100 + 2*5 + 2*2 = 114.
however, if we use `box-sizing: border-box;` then the padding and border are also included in the 100px width

## 3. The viewport

Open the website on a mobile browser, or in the mobile view of Chrome's
devtools, then delete this line from the `<head>` of `index.html`:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

What happens to your page? What does
this line tell the browser, and why does removing it affect your mobile design?

**Answer:**
